# OOP_PROJECT
I was assigned to make a project which uses all object oriented concepts using C++ language.

Introduction:
Our project will help any supermarket to operate smoothly, efficiently, and securely. Supermarkets must have a strong management system to operate efficiently and so to keep the customers satisfied. 
Firstly, the system will have a login system that will detect administrator/employee, and if program is compiled for the first time on a new device the first person will be considered as an admin because he/she is setting up the system and will get things going and will provide administrators. Administrator will have rights to modify item file(s) and employee file(s), any administrator can also remove/fire an administrator and there is a separate log file which holds who fired or added a new employee/admin.
Employees are responsible to generate a bill report and so they can add, remove, and show items from customer’s cart. Employees can view item file(s) to get the details of any item. In addition, an Employee or an Admin can also view his information only after if his login is successful.

Tools:
•	IDE used: Visual Code (+) Dev-C++.
•	Libraries used: iostream, fstream, cstring, cctype, vector, conio.h, windows.h
